# Oil Production Forecasting using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
Developed a predictive model to forecast daily oil output for upstream operations. This project focuses on handling the natural noise and volatility found in oil reservoir data to improve production scheduling.

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Model:** Linear Regression (for high interpretability)

## Key Features & Results
- **Lag Features:** Engineered multi-day lag features (t-1, t-2, t-3) to capture temporal dependencies.
- **Metrics:** Achieved an **R² of 0.81** and a **Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 28 bpd**.
- **Impact:** Enables data-driven maintenance scheduling and reduces unplanned downtime in upstream assets.
